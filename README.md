# Gift tracker
This is copy of a project that me and 5 other group members worked on for CS400 at UW madison. I worked on the GUI created with java FX and made sure that code worked together. The 5 other group members are cited in the code are in this list.
1. tnazareth@wisc.edu 
2. sdhossain@wisc.edu 
3. kadadha@wisc.edu 
4. probert@wisc.edu 
5. mbrudos@wisc.edu 
## Description
This is a local application that is used to track the gifts that a person needs to buy for the holidays. It stores gifts in a hashtable, people in a red black tree and writes to a csv file. The user is allowed to interact with the gift through a GUI created in JavaFX.
## How to run on linux with GUI
1. Clone this repo `git clone "https://Lmaobeh/GiftTracker-Copy"`
2. Download java and GNU make 
3. run the make file by running `make`
4. Follow GUI instructions.
- By default there will be names loaded in. They can be removed using the buttons.
